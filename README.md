Software Engineering Technical Lead at [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com].

I'm passionate about what it takes to deliver software, including writing, linting, testing, securing, deploying and releasing great software to end users. People are at the center of this, and how they work together, experiment, fail, and learn is something I love .a Enterprise DevOps & Agile Coach looking to help teams think differently and be more successful, and always learning along the way.

Averaging over 3500 code contributions to GitHub.com (inner and open source) in the last three years, I both advise and practice what I preach.
