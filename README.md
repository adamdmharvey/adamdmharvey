**Software Engineering Technical Lead at [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com).**

I'm passionate about what it takes to deliver software, including writing, linting, testing, securing, deploying and releasing great software to end users. People are at the center of this, and how they work together, experiment, fail, and learn is something I love to support. I've attended and organized Buildathons, coached teams on DevOps culture and practices as well as Agile techniques and backlog management, and built CI/CD pipelines to accelerate delivery.

Averaging over 3500 code contributions to GitHub.com (inner and open source) per year over the last three years, I both advise *and* practice what I preach.
